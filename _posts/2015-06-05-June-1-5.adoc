:hp-tags: python



Everyone's pretty much up and running now.  John and Kyle have been getting a fair amount of stuff done while I've been working on getting a new student up to speed with plain Python. Starting on Tuesday, I'm going to break the other students off into a group and have them start writing a version of the code for the robot together.  It's's good that Kyle and John are making progress, but ultimately the goal here is for the newer students to be up to speed before we hit build season.
